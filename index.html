			<h2>Effects of Creatine Supplementation and Doxorubicin Treatment on Myogenic Regulatory Factor Expression in Slow and Fast Twitch Muscle</h2>
			<h1>Abstract</h1>
			<p>Doxorubicin-induced myotoxicity is of particular concern for breast cancer patients. A co-treatment is necessary to prevent loss of skeletal muscle. Creatine upregulates myogenic regulatory factors, some of which are downregulated with doxorubicin treatment. The effect of creatine monohydrate supplementation on rats treated with doxorubicin, therefore, is of interest. Rats were fed either control diet or 3% creatine chow, and after two weeks, were given an i.p. saline or doxorubicin injection. Western blotting was performed to analyze the concentration of such factors in rat tissue, and an increasing trend was seen in MyoD and Mrf4 expression while a decrease in Myf5 and myogenin expression was noticed with DOX treatment. The trend of CR+DOX, within the soleus, increased Myf5 expression when compared to both CON and DOX.

			<!--<p>Cancer is a common yet devastating disease caused by mutation of cellular DNA and loss of cell cycle regulation (Campbell and Reece). Such mutation, called transformation, occurs as a result of exposure to mutagenic factors such as radiation and UV rays or with no apparent cause (Campbell and Reece). Cancer is expected to claim 13 million lives annually by 2030, and 21.7 million individuals are expected to be diagnosed annually by that year (“Global Cancer Facts & Figures”). Cancerous cells multiply rapidly, forming tumors, or masses of cancerous cells, and may metastasize, or migrate to other parts of the body, through the blood or lymphatic system, which poses an even greater danger (Campbell & Reece, 2007). Cancerous cells disrupt bodily activities as they consume resources as well as disrupt tissue structure and function (Campbell & Reece, 2007).
			<br><br>Any drug or treatment that can destroy cancerous cells, therefore, is of prime importance. Tumors of appropriate size, location, and type may be surgically removed. After surgery, swelling, drainage, bruising, or infection can result at the site of surgical treatment. Pain is common, and appetite loss and fatigue often result (Cancer.net Editorial Staff, 2016). Targeted radiation is used to destroy cancerous cells as their mutated genomes are more susceptible to further damage. However, radiation therapy can still damage healthy cells exposed to radiation near the irradiated site (Cancer.net Editorial Staff, 2017). These common treatments, however, fail to fight cancer outside a specific location; instead, chemotherapy treatments use chemicals that circulate throughout the body and destroy cancerous cells as well as some healthy cells (“Chemotherapy to Treat Cancer”). This often results in hair loss and blood disorders, since chemotherapeutic drugs damage hair follicles and inhibit the production of red blood cells in bone marrow (“Chemotherapy to Treat Cancer”). As with other treatments, pain and nausea can result. These chemicals may include those that inhibit specific components of cell division or the cell cycle or may cause cell death (Yang, et al). Doxorubicin, a specific cancer drug part of the anthracycline class of anticancer drugs, uses several methods to prevent the division or function of cancer cells, including intercalation between hydrogen-bonded Guanine and Cytosine as well as Topoisomerase II poisoning (Yang, et al). 
			<br><br>A critical side effect of doxorubicin treatment is myotoxicity. Treatment with doxorubicin has been found to downregulate myogenin and MyoD, two factors necessary for the production of muscle cells and the fusion of myoblasts (Yang, et al). This contributes to the loss of skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle.</p>
			<p>The current review will focus on the toxicity of doxorubicin toward skeletal muscle.</p><br>-->
